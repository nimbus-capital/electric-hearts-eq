## :point_right: How to install on Mac
1. Download and unzip the latest release.
2. Open the contents of the "**AU**" folder from the release ZIP.
3. Drag the contents (all of the .component files) to the **Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components** folder.

The plugins should load on any AU-compatible DAW; please see [DAW support](#daw-support) below for more details.

## Windows and Linux support
I currently don't own a PC and therefore don't have a way to test this outside of a Mac environment. If you have some experience using [Blue Cat's Plug'n Script](https://www.bluecataudio.com/Products/Product_PlugNScript/)
and would like to contribute by creating and testing VST3 versions, please create an Issue or send an Instagram DM to [@andysnowdj](https://www.instagram.com/andysnowdj/).

## DAW support
Once deposited into **Macintosh HD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components**, the plugins should appear under "Electric Hearts" in any AU-compatible DAW.

### Confirmed working
- **Logic Pro**
- **Ableton Live** - under Live > Settings >  Plug-Ins, ensure *Use Audio Units v2* is enabled and click the *Rescan* button
